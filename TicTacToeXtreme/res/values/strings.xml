In TicTacToe Xtreme, the player needs to get three of his pieces in a row, diagonal, or column. On the board, there are mystery boxes with the label \'?\' that can be picked up by each player. Once a player lands a piece on one of those mystery boxes, the player gets a random power-up. The power-ups are 2x, swap, and bomb.\n
-Bomb gets rid of all pieces in a  one radius area and causes the other pieces to fall down.\n
-2x lets the player take two turns in a row.\n
-The swap switches the selected piece with the piece directly above it.\n
\n
The pieces must be placed going from bottom to top vertically. If a player gets three pieces in a row to match, then that play WINS! Otherwise, it\'s a CAT! There can be up to three players per game.\n
\n
To use the NFC feature, simply open the app on two devices and place them back to back. Tap on the screen of the device you want to transfer from. That\'s it, we take care of the rest!
